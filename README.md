# Problem Statement
---
 Adventure Works represents a cycling company with data on products,sales,customers and employees. Despite the growing customer base there seems to be a decrease in revenue generated between the years 2015 and 2017.With the help of data analysis we will help the mangement team  try to understand the customers spending patterns and the reason for the decrease in revenue thus implementing strategies to improve performance
 Data was collected on the customers,demographics,sales,products purchased,period of purchases,product category,date of purchase,country etc. Using the data provided I will be answering the following questions which further summarize the data set making it easier to come up with and implement strategies.
 * Which gender had the most patonage?
 * Which customers by educational level patronised the most?
 * Based on income segment which customers patronised the most?
 * Which country had the most patronage?
 * What are tthe top 5 products by revenue?
