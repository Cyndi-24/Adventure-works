# Introduction
---
I took up this project to challenge myself,further improve my analytics skills and gain more experience in the use of PowerBI.
---

# Problem Statement
---
 Adventure Works represents a cycling company with data on products,sales,customers and employees. Despite the growing customer base there seems to be a decrease in revenue generated between the years 2015 and 2017.With the help of data analysis we will help the mangement team  try to understand the customers spending patterns and the reason for the decrease in revenue thus implementing strategies to improve performance
 Data was collected on the customers,demographics,sales,products purchased,period of purchases,product category,date of purchase,country etc. Using the data provided I will be answering the following questions along with the use of KPI's which further summarize the data set making it easier to come up with and implement strategies.
 * Which gender had the most patonage?
 * Which customers by educational level patronised the most?
 * Based on income segment which customers patronised the most?
 * Which country had the most customers?
 * What are the top 5 products by revenue?
 * Who are the top 10 customers by revenue?
 * What was the revenue generated by each product category?
 * What  was the monthly revenue?
 * What revenue was generated by each country?

# DATA SOURCING
 This dataset was gotten from Kaggle.com, a website which offers a vast repository of datasets which can be used for personal projects and competitions for data enthusiasts and professionals
 ---
 
 # SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
 ---
 * Data Importation;
   The dataset was saved in csv format and imported into PowerBI
 ---
 * Data Transformation;
  After importing the data to PowerBI, I did a lot of transformation using PowerBI query editor which involved removing unnecessary 
  columns and rows,removing duplicates,adding new columns and rows where necessary,formating the data types for each column,merging the 
  date tables using append query and creating a calendar date table using DAX measures to make the analysis easier.
---
 * Data Modelling
   I have nine tables;
   * AdventureWorks_Customers
   * AdventureWorks_Product_category
   * AdventureWorks_Product_Subcategory
   * AdventureWorks_Product
   * AdventureWorks_Returns
   * AdventureWorks_Sales_2015
   * AdventureWorks_Sales_2016
   * AdventureWorks_Sales_2017
   * AdventureWorks_Territory
     
   Loading the data set created an automatic data model but adjustments were made which include;
   * Adding a calendar table to the model
   * Using DAX for cross-filtering instead of setting cross filtering direction to both as this allows for more dynamic filtering
   * With the help of dax measures I was able to analyze the dataset,calculate ,add aggregated columns etc
  
     The image below shows the adjusted model view
